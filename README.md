# 100 Days Of Code Diary

## Day 1

_May 22_

### Today's Progress:
- Started reviewing basic JavaScript concepts (variables, assignment operators and string operations)

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
I'm feeling very excited to do the 100 Days of Code challenge again! In my first ever tech job, I worked as a fullstack developer, but the technologies that we used there (JSF and PrimeFaces) are not something I would choose to build a modern, responsive website/web application. Despite the fact that I dabbled into JavaScript and React before, I don't have enough knowledge to start building my own application from scratch. Being able to build good looking web apps is something I've been wanting to learn for quite a while, so I decided to take part in the challenge again in order to stay consistent and possibly build have a small portfolio of a few projects that I'm hopefully going to build in the upcoming 100 days! Let's do this!
