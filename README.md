# 100 Days Of Code Diary

## Day 1

_May 22_

### Today's Progress:
- Started reviewing basic JavaScript concepts (variables, assignment operators and string operations)

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
I'm feeling very excited to do the 100 Days of Code challenge again! In my first ever tech job, I worked as a fullstack developer, but the technologies that we used there (JSF and PrimeFaces) are not something I would choose to build a modern, responsive website/web application. Despite the fact that I dabbled into JavaScript and React before, I don't have enough knowledge to start building my own application from scratch. Being able to build good looking web apps is something I've been wanting to learn for quite a while, so I decided to take part in the challenge again in order to stay consistent and possibly build have a small portfolio of a few projects that I'm hopefully going to build in the upcoming 100 days! Let's do this!

## Day 2

_May 23_

### Today's Progress:
- Continued with string operations in JS
- Learned about JS arrays and array operations like `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()` and `.unshift()`
- Reviewed JS functions
- Reviewed difference between global and local scope in JS

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
It was a bit more challenging to make time for studying today as I worked from the office and also had some afternoon plans. The fact that I started the challenge definitely helped!

As a Java developer, I was (once again) surprised by the fact that JS arrays can contain any types of data. Another thing that I found interesting is how declaring variables without `let` or `const` keyword automatically makes them global, which can lead to unintended consequences.

## Day 3

_May 24_

### Today's Progress:
- Practicied writing functions in JS & learned different values returned from them (e.g. if function doesn't have a `return` statement, the returned value is `undefined`)
- `if`, `else`, `else if`, and `switch` statements
- Comparison operators
- **Type coercion** and `==` vs `===` & `!=` vs `!==`
- `typeof`
- Logical operators

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
I'll be repeating myself, but it was (even) a bit more challenging to make time for studying today. I only managed to start studying at 9pm. Surprisingly, I was able to focus just fine, but the study session would definitely be more enjoyable if I studied earlier in the day. Similarly to yesterday, I find it surprising/shocking that no return type has to be defined when creating a function (I seriously have to stop comparing JS to Java!).

## Day 4

_May 25_

### Today's Progress:
- Did exercises with `switch` statements and learned how to simplify if/else statements in JS (which is actually the same as in Java:

Instead of writing:
```
function isEqual(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

You can write:
```
function isEqual(a, b) {
  return a === b;
}
```

- Then I started learning about JS objects which work very differently from Java, so I was taking my time today in order to really understand everything there is to learn about the topic
- Regarding objects, I learned how to create new objects, how to access their properties, and also how to update/delete properties

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
Learning about JS objects is truly enjoyable and fascinating because the way objects are created and how we can modify/add/delete their proberties is just so different and interesting. Can't wait to learn more about the topic tomorrow!

## Day 5

_May 26_

### Today's Progress:
- Review all main topics from previous days (especially JS objects)
- JS objects exercises
- Manipulating complex objects: Nested objects and nested arrays

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
Too tired today - more thoughts tomorrow!

## Day 6

_May 27_

### Today's Progress:
- Review objects again and do more JS objects exercises
- Loops in JS (`while`, `do...while`, `for` loops and nested `for` loops)
- Loops exercises

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
Object manipulation in JavaScript REALLY confuses me. I worked on solving a few exercises in the freeCodeCamp curriculum today and they were so much more challenging than I thought they would be! The next topic coming up is recursion, which I didn't entirely understand during my bootcamp studies, so I'm excited to revisit it and hopefully fully get it this time.
