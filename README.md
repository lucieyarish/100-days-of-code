# 100 Days Of Code Diary

## Day 1

_May 22_

### Today's Progress:
- Started reviewing basic JavaScript concepts (variables, assignment operators and string operations)

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
I'm feeling very excited to do the 100 Days of Code challenge again! In my first ever tech job, I worked as a fullstack developer, but the technologies that we used there (JSF and PrimeFaces) are not something I would choose to build a modern, responsive website/web application. Despite the fact that I dabbled into JavaScript and React before, I don't have enough knowledge to start building my own application from scratch. Being able to build good looking web apps is something I've been wanting to learn for quite a while, so I decided to take part in the challenge again in order to stay consistent and possibly build have a small portfolio of a few projects that I'm hopefully going to build in the upcoming 100 days! Let's do this!

## Day 2

_May 23_

### Today's Progress:
- Continued with string operations in JS
- Learned about JS arrays and array operations like `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()` and `.unshift()`
- Reviewed JS functions
- Reviewed difference between global and local scope in JS

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
It was a bit more challenging to make time for studying today as I worked from the office and also had some afternoon plans. The fact that I started the challenge definitely helped!

As a Java developer, I was (once again) surprised by the fact that JS arrays can contain any types of data. Another thing that I found interesting is how declaring variables without `let` or `const` keyword automatically makes them global, which can lead to unintended consequences.

## Day 3

_May 24_

### Today's Progress:
- Practicied writing functions in JS & learned different values returned from them (e.g. if function doesn't have a `return` statement, the returned value is `undefined`)
- `if`, `else`, `else if`, and `switch` statements
- Comparison operators
- **Type coercion** and `==` vs `===` & `!=` vs `!==`
- `typeof`
- Logical operators

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
I'll be repeating myself, but it was (even) a bit more challenging to make time for studying today. I only managed to start studying at 9pm. Surprisingly, I was able to focus just fine, but the study session would definitely be more enjoyable if I studied earlier in the day. Similarly to yesterday, I find it surprising/shocking that no return type has to be defined when creating a function (I seriously have to stop comparing JS to Java!).

## Day 4

_May 25_

### Today's Progress:
- Did exercises with `switch` statements and learned how to simplify if/else statements in JS (which is actually the same as in Java:

Instead of writing:
```
function isEqual(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

You can write:
```
function isEqual(a, b) {
  return a === b;
}
```

- Then I started learning about JS objects which work very differently from Java, so I was taking my time today in order to really understand everything there is to learn about the topic
- Regarding objects, I learned how to create new objects, how to access their properties, and also how to update/delete properties

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
Learning about JS objects is truly enjoyable and fascinating because the way objects are created and how we can modify/add/delete their proberties is just so different and interesting. Can't wait to learn more about the topic tomorrow!

## Day 5

_May 26_

### Today's Progress:
- Review all main topics from previous days (especially JS objects)
- JS objects exercises
- Manipulating complex objects: Nested objects and nested arrays

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
Too tired today - more thoughts tomorrow!

## Day 6

_May 27_

### Today's Progress:
- Review objects again and do more JS objects exercises
- Loops in JS (`while`, `do...while`, `for` loops and nested `for` loops)
- Loops exercises

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
Object manipulation in JavaScript REALLY confuses me. I worked on solving a few exercises in the freeCodeCamp curriculum today and they were so much more challenging than I thought they would be! The next topic coming up is recursion, which I didn't entirely understand during my bootcamp studies, so I'm excited to revisit it and hopefully fully get it this time.

## Day 7

_May 28_

### Today's Progress:
- Recursion

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
Today was all about recursion. I did learn about this concept at my programming bootcamp, but didn't have enought time to fully grasp it back then. For a few minutes, I thought I did understant it today, but when I wanted to solve a freeCodeCamp recursion exercise, I couldn't figure it out. So instead of rushing through the JS curriculum, I decided to read a few articles to better understand the topic.

Tomorrow I'm going to try adjusting my daily routine and study first thing in the morning. Leaving 100 days of code for evenings has been a mistake because I'm usually pretty exhausted after work and workouts.

## Day 8

_May 29_

### Today's Progress:
- Recursion again
- More object exercises
- Generating random frictions and whole numbers with `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`
- `parseInt` function
- Ternary operators & multiple conditional operators

Study time: 1,5 hours

### Thoughts:
Hi recursion & objects, my old friends. I did a few more recursion & object exercises and I needed to use the hint function on freeCodeCamp! I couldn't figure out how to work with an array of objects since it wasn't one of the function's parameters and then I found out that I wasn't supposed to do that. Instead, I should have just manipulate an objects array that was already defined in the context. Oh well! I was planning on finishing the whole Basic JavaScript section today, but there are two more RECURSION exercises (more difficult than the ones I did over the past few days), so I'm gonna save those for tomorrow!

By the way, I DID manage to study before work today, but I've been feeling a bit tired from getting up so early today. I guess one can't have it all! I'll see how much time I'll be able to devote to studying in the upcoming days since I really have to focus on learning some DDD and CQRS concepts at my new job.

## Day 9

_May 30_

### Today's Progress:
- JavaScript ES6 modules
- JS array/object destructuring
- React: The most important concepts

Study time: 1,5 hours

### Thoughts:
Instead of continuing the JS freeCodeCamp course, I had to watch videos on React and important JS concepts, like array/object desctructuring and ES6 modules because I was assigned quite a few frontend tasks for this sprint. I think that I'm going to learn the most by actually working on the features, but I have to have some basic knowledge before I start. Tomorrow I'm planning to look into more React videos, and maybe also some about TypeScript & Redux. Why don't days have at least 30 hours?

All videos I watched today are on a YouTube channel [https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified](Web Dev Simplified). I really like Kyle's way of explaining things, so I 100% recommend you check out his videos!:)

- Desctructuring via rest elements

Study time: 1 hour & 15 mins

### Thoughts:
Some aspects of destructuring are easy to understand, but using destructuring to pass an object as a function's parameters is definitely something I'll have to revisit tomorrow and try some more exercises to fully grasp it.

Study time: 2 hours & 15 mins

### Thoughts:
Besides learning more ES6 topics, I also started a course recommended by my mentor at work. The project I'm working on consists of microservices, CQRS, event sourcing and Axon, so I want to make sure I learn all the concepts properly in order to better understand the code base.

### Today's Progress:
- SKIPPED (no train internet)

Study time: 0 hours

## Day 16

_June 6_

### Today's Progress:
ES6 topics:
- JS modules
- `export`, `import`, `export default`
- Promises

Study time: 1 hour & 20 mins

### Thoughts:
Couldn't study yesterday because I didn't have any internet during my only free time (train ride). Today I was, again, going over JS ES6 topics.

## Day 17

_June 7_

### Today's Progress:
Basic data structures:
- Arrays and array operations

Study time: 1 hour

### Thoughts:
After finishing the ES6 section, I decided to skip sections about regular expressions & debugging, and went straight for the basic data structures section of the course, as that is more important for me to learn at the moment. I'm definitely going to go back to the skipped part once I have more time and have enough JS knowledge to start with React & TS.
